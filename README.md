Carlisle can be easily deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-hugo-with-vercel). Check out the live demo at [carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app](https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app).

To use this template, simply install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), fork this repository, and start customizing.
